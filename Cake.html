    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cup plain flour</li>    
         <li> 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg</li>  
         <li>  1/4 tsp salt</li> 
        <li> Icing sugar for dusting</li> 
           <li> Vegetable oil for frying</li>
          <li>2 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>  
         <li> 2 large eggs, separated</li>  
          <li>1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp sugar</li>  
          <li> 2 tbsp lemon juice</li> 
            <li>1 tsp lemon zest</li>
           <li> 2 medium tart apples, peeled and coarsely grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Toss the grated apple with the lemon zest, juice, and the cinnamon and let sit a few minutes (to soften the apple).
        </li>
        <li> Whisk the sour cream, 1/2 cup of the sugar and egg yolks to blend.
            Stir in the grated apple (including any juices). In a separate bowl, sift
            the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Stir this into the
            sour cream mixture until blended, then stir in the melted butter. Whip
            the egg whites until foamy then add 2 tablespoons of sugar and
            continue whipping until they hold a soft peak. Fold the whites into the
            batter and use right away.</li>
            <li>Pour the oil into a tabletop deep fryer following manufacturerâ€™s
                instructions (or into a large, deep pot so that it is only filled about 3
                inches). Heat the oil to 350F (use a candy thermometer if cooking
                doughnuts in a pot). Have a baking tray lined with paper towel, with a
                cooling rack placed over it. Use a small ice cream scoop and carefully
                drop scoops of batter into the oil, making sure there is enough room
                between them to cook evenly. Cook the fritters for about 3 minutes on
                each side, then remove using a slotted spoon and let drain and cool
                for at least 10 minutes before dusting and enjoying.
                </li>

                <li>The fritters can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature on the day
                    they are cooked
                </li>
    </ol>
